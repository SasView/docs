This folder is the docs that were uploaded to the website at the time of the 5.0.3 release.

This means these are the docs with the missing/broken .py source code links.

These docs were replaced on 21/08/2020 by those from a special build due to the problem described in https://github.com/SasView/sasmodels/pull/421.

This folder can be removed once we are content that the special build docs in the top level folder do not contain any oddities of their own...
